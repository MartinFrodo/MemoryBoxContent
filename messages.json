We made\nplans to meet and\ntogether figured out\nways to meet though\nthe whole republic.\nI started one of\nthe best and most\ninteresting times\nof my life, talking\nto you, getting to\nknow you and myself.\nI had learned a great\ndeal about myself.\nThe more I talked\nto you the more\nI realized how much\nI loved you, and that\nI am never going\nto give up you and\nalso us. Thank you\nfor being in my life.\nYou mean the world\nto me, you ARE my world.\nI love you bye <3"
